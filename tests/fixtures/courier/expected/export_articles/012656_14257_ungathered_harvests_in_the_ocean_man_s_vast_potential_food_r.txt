Man's vast potential food reserve
UNGATHERED HARVESTS
N THE OCEAN
by Mack Laing
I N the thick of a world¬
wide struggle against hung¬
er and malnutrition, man turns to the
sea for food and finds how poorly
he has named his planet Earth. The
connotation of Earth as a green world
of plenty is being dimmed. Millions
of her people are hungry and sick,
and sick and well alike are being
crowded rapidly toward the limit.
In 1930, there were 40 people per
square mile of total land area; now
there are 63; by the year 2,000 there
will be 142. We have begun to realize
as never before that only 30 per cent
of the so-called Earth is land area.
The rest is ocean, the only such ocean
in our entire solar system.
Meanwhile we must feed a popula¬
tion that grows at the rate of more
than 60 million a year. But only one-
tenth of the earth is under cultiva-

Agriculture Organization, Rome.
tion and about two-thirds of that is
grassland of varying quality. These
are the main supports for our hungry
millions. And while the land supplies
grain, vegetables and fruits, it does
not yield directly the animal protein
that builds muscle and provides
stamina for continued work. The
conversion from vegetable to animal
protein comes through livestock and
this conversion costs us one-quarter
of all crops and one-half of all the
world's grain crops which go to feed
animals.
Once again we turn to the sea.
Here is a food-producing machine,
automatic, sun-powered, so far un-
managed, a warehouse of high-quality
food, withholding its wealth for the
right combination of keys. It is
estimated that, acre for acre, the sea
can produce as much as arable land,
yet the sea has twice the surface
area of Earth's total land and seven
times the area of land now under
cultivation. Can the sea be unlocked
to provide at least a partial solution
to our hunger? Yes, definitely. Will
the seas and inland waters someday
outrival Earth's agricultural production
and allow us greater breathing space
on the land ? Possibly, conceivably,
too soon to tell.
The present situation in world
fisheries has both optimistic and pes¬
simistic notes. On the bright side,
the world's fishermen now catch more
fish than ever before. Each year since
1945 has provided a record catch.
The 1964 catch 52 million metric tons
is double the 1953 catch. For com¬
parison with land-grown animal protein,
world fisheries production by 1962 was
exceeding beef and veal production by
18 million tons and pork production by
25 million tons.
The discouraging part of these fig¬
ures is that the fish is not being
taken by those who need it most.
First, between one-quarter and one-
third of the 1964 catch was taken by
only two countries Peru and Japan.
Second, only ten countries account¬
ed for the top 62 per cent of the total
catch. Finally, 95 per cent was taken
by the leading 43 fishing nations.

There are about 220 independent or
dependent countries or territories, but,
even discounting those few which
have no marine or even inland
fisheries, these figures mean that per¬
haps 160 countries share only five
per cent of the world fish catch.
This imbalance also shows clearly
in a geographical distribution. Nearly
70 per cent of the 1964 marine catch
was taken from four big areas in the
northern hemisphere, the traditional
fishing grounds of the northeast and
northwest Atlantic and the west-cen¬
tral and north Pacific. These are the
areas fished most by the countries
which use the most modern fishing
gear and methods. Protein deficient
areas such as the Caribbean, parts
of Latin America, Asia and Africa pro¬
duced low tonnages and some pro¬
portion of even this catch was taken
by far-ranging trawlers from the more
developed fishing countries.
The reason for these discrepancies
is simply development; industrializa¬
tion. Since 1945 the technological
revolution that occurred with agricul¬
ture in the advanced countries long
ago, finally hit the fishing business.
Advanced nations soon had elec¬
tronic sounding devices to locate fish
schools. Shipyards produced better
boats; new engines began to shrink
sea distances. The textile industry
came out with new synthetic fibres
which made strong, rot-resisting nets.
New refrigeration techniques made it
possible to process fish at sea. Coun¬
tries with established rail and road
networks were able to distribute
fishery products far inland, through
extensive "cold chains" using refrig¬
erated trucks and railway cars.
Meanwhile, without the skills, capi¬
tal and industrial basis to seize these
innovations and turn them into oppor¬
tunity, the developing nations remain¬
ed far behind in fisheries develop¬
ment. This is why an Icelandic fisher¬
man accounts for an average annual
catch of more than 100 tons, while an
average fisherman in most tropical
areas will take only about one ton
of fish a year. Behind each Icelandic
fisherman there are many thousands
of dollars invested in boats, gear and
training. In the developing countries
we are trying to remedy this techno¬
logical gap, with varying degrees of
success, by sending technical assis¬
tance experts in specific kinds of fish¬
ing and by setting up entire fisheries
institutes.
Meanwhile, the technological revo¬
lution advances, always outstripping
the nations least prepared for it and
in most need of its benefits. Great
fleets of trawlers from Japan, U.S.S.R.
and a few other countries now roam
almost every sea, catching, freezing
and transferring fish to shore bases
or transport ships.
Some boats are able to operate
almost in "push-button" style, finding
a shoal of fish by Sonar, letting down
a trawl and directing this net with
the aid of television cameras mount¬
ed on the trawl mouth. The latest
news in fishing boat design is that
months of drawing and model-testing
can now be avoided by programming
an electronic computer to give "ideal"
specifications for a boat of a certain
type or size or for use in certain
sea conditions. Again, in the develop¬
ing countries, where the majority of
the world's boatyards are, most boats
are built from memory and rule of
thumb, without even rough drawings.
If the waters of the world are now
producing more than 50 million tons
of food a year, how much more can
they produce? The answer "we
don't know" illustrates man's great
Ignorance of the sea. The sea's pro¬
duction may be very large, but it is
not unlimited. It is limited by photo¬
synthesis, the process by which tiny
sea plants called plankton are able to
grow by absorbing sunlight. Some
attempts at measuring this growth
rate have been made. By estimat¬
ing the amount of plankton and its
growth rate, the sea's "primary pro¬
duction" can be guessed at.
In 1961, two scientists estimated
this primary production at 500 thous¬
and million metric tons per year for
all seas. In the sea's food chain we
might assume that small, plant-eating
animals feed off the plankton, are in
turn eaten by a class of small fish,
which are in turn devoured by larger
fish. At each stage there is a certain

Drawing "Science and Technology"
Two-thirds of the surface of our planet is covered
by seas and oceans, which combine to form
a single vast world ocean. As this "petal"

their names, ultimately mingle around Antarctica.

loss in material. Counting these
losses, the estimated possible result
from the original 500 thousand million
tons of plant food would be one
thousand million tons of fish.
But any estimate of primary produc¬
tion is bound to be weak. This is
because the life processes of the
phytoplankton at one place vary from
hour to hour and season to season.
It also grows at different rates in
different areas. It Is possible to cal¬
culate from some estimates that the
world's catch of codfish requires
seaplant production equivalent to 22
world wheat crops, which would mean,
on the same basis, that the present
world catch of fish brings man the
equivalent of almost 100 times more
primary plant protein than is involved
in the entire agriculture of the earth.
Until better information is available,
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organ¬
ization continues on its estimate that
the world fish catch could be doubl¬
ed without endangering basic fish
stocks.
Many ideas none so far very
practical have been advanced on
how to increase our harvest of food
from the world's waters. Since the
best fishing grounds occur where
upwelling currents bring bottom food
up into the zone of light penetration
where most commercial species live,
it has been suggested that artificial
upwellings should be created in the
tropics, where few exist, by lowering
nuclear reactors. The economics of
this up to now have shown that there
would be a tremendous energy waste.
Economics and physical laws also
have hindered the use of electricity
for marine fishing. Fish are attract¬
ed and stunned by a current, and
electrical fishing has been known on
a small scale in streams and shallow
lakes for more than 50 years. But
salt water dissipates a continuous
electrical force, even with equipment
generating 7,000 kilowatts enough
power to supply a small town. German
engineers have reported success with
a fraction of this power by sending
a series of strong electrical pulses
into the water. The German and Sov¬
iet fishing fleets have reportedly
been experimenting with this tech¬
nique.
The Russians have also apparently
begun experimental attempts to catch
fish with submarines and American
scientists have predicted that fish
could be lured with electronic sounds
or chemicals and simply sucked into
special holds in a ship's hull.
Whatever the limits of sea produc¬
tion, there seem to be no limits to
the inventiveness of the new technol¬
ogy of modern fishing. The obvious

qualification to the new ideas is that
most of them depend on a sound
knowledge of fish behaviour, which
we simply do not have.
One of the more immediate hopes
we have is the mid-water trawl. The
usual commercial trawl net is dragged
along the bottom. But our charts of
the shallow continental shelves, poor
as they are, show there is not much
bottom left which has not been trawl¬
ed many times. Therefore, there
would seem to be good prospects for
a trawl which rides a considerable
distance off the bottom. This type of
gear is available but has seen no
large-scale commercial use yet.
By far the most practical idea for
increasing supplies of fish protein is
simply to use the great quantity of
fish now caught, but not used. Many
species, because they look ugly or
have harsh-sounding -names, will not
be accepted by consumers, despite
their being excellent high-quality food.
The "redfish" was one, until it was
processed into fillets and rechristen-
ed "ocean perch", which now sells
well. The same idea of dressing up
the product as fish sticks or paste
or other more attractive forms leads
to more sales and more incentive to
catch fish and avoid wasting its
protein.
The other great force toward a
sensible use of protein resources is
inland fisheries. Nearly 12 per cent
of the 1964 world catch came from
fresh water. Just as important, nearly
three-quarters of the Inland catch came
from protein-deficient Asia; Africa
produced almost as much as U.S.S.R.;
South America produced as much as
Europe and more than North America.
Again, in fresh water fisheries, we see
an expanding technology, but this is
backed up by centuries of experience
in the Far East and, unlike the sea,
there is a better possibility of control¬
ling production conditions in inland
waters.
In inland fisheries, it is quite within
possibility that the waters can be
"farmed" in much the same way as
the land. Despite a good deal of
futuristic talk, this is not so far prac¬
tical In the sea. Yet, as with every
idea in fisheries, our general Ignorance
has provided us with a wide range
of opinion.
The optimists point to 17,000 dif¬
ferent species of algae, plankton and
seaweed, some of which can produce
50 crops a year, with almost 100 per
cent of the plant usable as food. Kelp
and other large seaweeds have been

Outdated techniques limit the catches of many countries. Ten
countries alone those which use modern fishing gear and methods

used for centuries, especially in the
Far East, for fertilizer, fodder and
human consumption. Algae or algae
extracts are now used In Japan, for
example, in bread, cakes, ice cream,
soups, soap, explosives, cosmetics
and toothpaste.
But when algae are offered as a
large-scale solution to the hunger
problem, the pessimists are quick to
point out practical difficulties. To
provide one man with enough calories
for a day's work through algae, they
say, would mean straining several
thousand cubic metres of sea water.
They say algal cells are so well pro¬
tected by nature that man would not
digest them easily. Again, until we
know a lot more about the sea's
grasses, that part of the ocean's ware¬
house which is the granary remains
locked.
Another intriguing possibility for
increasing world food supplies lies
not in plankton, but in krill, a shrimp-
like creature as long as a matchstick,
which feeds on the plankton of the
unexploited southern ocean. Unlike
plankton and the problem of strain¬
ing sea water to get at it, krill occurs
in enormous densely-packed shoals.
It is the main diet of the great south¬
ern whales, and, since whale stocks
have been decimated by unscrupulous
killing, the vast areas of krill have
Increased. In late 1962, solid data
on krill distribution began to be
published. The famous British scien¬
tist, Sir Alister Hardy, has said he
is sure that krill will save the starv¬
ing children of the world and that
within 20 years krill may be making
the greatest addition of the century to
man's food supplies.
Husbanding of marine fish has
already been tried. Young plaice have
been raised in tanks from hatching,
through the most dangerous part of
their lives, until they are ready for
release into the sea. A plant on the
Isle of Man is expected to turn out
a million fish a year.

-------------------- Page 15 --------------------

A technique tried 50 years ago to
increase fish size was to catch young
fish on overcrowded grounds and
transfer them to richer grounds. Those
transferred grew several times as
large as those left behind. A scheme
to make such transfers regularly, fail¬
ed. No one nation was going to pay
to release fish where other nations
could easily catch them. International
co-operation has improved since then.
One of the most unusual situations
in world fisheries is the case of Latin
America. Since 1957, Latin American
fisheries production has increased
nearly 1,000 per cent, while world
production has increased only about
65 per cent. However, in at least half
a dozen Latin American countries, fish
production increased little or not at
all, and in seven, including Mexico
and Cuba, production increases have
been about 50 per cent since 1957.
The key is anchoveta, a finger-length
fish found in great easily-caught
schools off western South America.
On the strength of this little fish, Peru
became the world's greatest fish pro¬
ducer in 1962, and Peru and Chile are
responsible for 90 per cent of Latin
American production and 20 per cent
of the world catch.
Could the anchoveta contribute to
the solution of Latin America's protein
deficit? The theoretical case is very
strong. In 1962, for example, nutri¬
tionists estimated that Latin America
needed 1.2 million metric tons of ani¬
mal protein annually. That year's Peru¬
vian and Chilean fish catch totalled
7.5 million tons, which contained about
1.3 million tons of protein. However,
considering that only half of this
7.5 million tons live weight would be
suitable for direct human consumption,
at least 40 per cent of the 1962 Latin
American protein' requirement could
theoretically have been met by the
catches of these two countries. On
the same basis, it seems quite within
the fisheries development possibilities
of the continent to be able to provide,
in theory, for all increases in protein
demands by Latin America's expanding
population over the next 20 years.
These figures are theoretical since,
in fact, 95 per cent of the 1962 ancho¬
veta catch, for example, was ground
into fishmeal, most of it for export to
United States and Europe as pig and
chicken feed. In effect, Peru and
Chile that year exported one million
metric tons of animal protein to put
pork and chicken on the tables of
nations already well fed.
This example is not intended as any
adverse comment on these countries,
but is used merely to point out what
the effect of fisheries economics can
be on human nutrition. The economic
fact is that Peru and Chile, desperately
short of foreign capital, gained
110 million dollars from the anchoveta
in 1962 and this money was invested
for development, including fisheries
development. The example is also
used to illustrate the importance of
fishmeal.
Late last year, the New York Times
announced a "breakthrough" in the
solution to the world food crisis fish¬
meal for human consumption. It was
said that studies indicated that if
unharvested fish in American coastal
waters were made into concentrate,
this would provide the normal protein
requirements for nearly one-third of
the world's population for 300 days at
a base production cost of half a cent
per person per day.
In the manufacture, whole, fresh fish
are pulped, then moved through a bath
of cold ¡sopropyl alcohol to eliminate
most of the water and fat. They go
Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
through two more stages under hot
¡sopropyl alcohol, stirring in kettles,
and after drying, an off-white flour¬
like substance remains. This is fish
protein concentrate. There are three
types for human consumption, varying
from 60 to 80 per cent protein. It can
be mixed into bread, macaroni and
other foods. Any "fishy" taste can
be removed during manufacture.
It has been possible to make such
a clean, safe, high-quality and cheap
product for several years. So far it
has been mostly manufactured for
experiments, though recently several
companies in Morocco, South Africa
and the United States have begun
selling it for institutional feeding at
retail prices ranging from $170 to $350
a ton. Experiments at the Anglo-
American Clinic in Lima, Peru, provide
encouraging results of its effective¬
ness in combating children's diseases
caused by protein deficiency, such as
kwashiorkor.
It may be one of our best answers
against malnutrition. But before we
can throw it in full force into the fight,
we need more economic and social
data, particularly on Its acceptability
to consumers. We need nutritional
data on how to use this concentrate
in the daily dishes of various countries
to improve diets. Some of these ques¬
tions are under study at the FAO-
founded Instituto del Mar in Peru.
Very recently two of our FAO De¬
partment of Fisheries staff members
made an interesting calculation on the
contribution fishmeal could make to
human diets and the amount of fish
required. They said that to increase
the daily diet of one million people by
five grammes of protein in the form of
fish protein concentrate containing 65
per cent protein, an annual tonnage of
about 16,000 metric tons of whole fish
would be required.
Though this increase of five gram¬
mes of animal protein is small, It is
still significant in some countries. For
example, the average daily animal pro¬
tein intake per person for Africa as a
whole is only 11 grammes, of which
only 1.3 grammes now comes from fish.
A per person increase of five gram¬
mes of animal protein for all Africa
would be a jump forward toward the
short-term target of 18 grammes for the
continent. The objective of this short-
term target is elimination of under¬
nutrition and a reasonable improvement
in nutritional quality of the diet.
The proportion of the total world
catch reduced to meal and oils for
animal feeds rose from 13 per cent in
1958 to 30 per cent in 1964, or 35 per * p
cent if the world Inland catch is Id
excluded. It seems obvious that if we
could upgrade some part of this animal
