SEÑORITA
LUCIANA
Teacher in
the High Andes
Luciana Luna Yabar, a 26-year-old teacher
from Lima, the capital of Peru, was appoint¬
ed to run a small school in the province
of Cuzco for three years. Señorita Lu-
ciana's first problem was how to reach her
isolated post. She took a plane from Lima
to Cuzco and then spent an entire day in
a bus which took her to Paucartambo, a
village whose people live at a height of
3,500 metres (11,500 feet) in the heart of
the Andes. Setting off alone on horseback
across the vast Cordillera (right), she had
to cross a mountain pass 4,800 metres (al¬
most 16,000 feet) high. It was two days
before she covered the 115 kilometres (70
miles) and reached the school located in
the buildings of an abandoned farm. For
nine months each year this is her home,
until she returns to Lima for her annual
three months' vacation. Luciana's pupils
are Quero Indian children, aged eight to
13, whose parents breeders of llamas,
vicunas and alpacas live anything from 20
to 40 kilometres (12 to 25 miles) away.
Because of the distance they have to walk,
the children stay at the school from Mon¬
day morning to Friday evening. Water for
this austere "boarding school" comes from
melting glaciers, and in winter the school
is heated with fires of dead wood collected
on the mountains. Luciana shares to the
full the life of her pupils, and encourages
and watches over their games and recrea¬
tions (left). The children learn about hy¬
giene and are taught Spanish (their own
language is Quechua). They also learn to
read, write and count in Spanish. Luciana
has her own simple little room whose only
furnishings are a wooden bed and a llama
wool blanket. She earns 1,400 soles (£18
or $50) a month, and sometimes uses part
of her salary to pay for school supplies.

SEÑORITA LUCIANA (Continued)
Mealtime at school (left). Every
two weeks a man rides over
from the nearest village, 110 kilometres
(70 miles) away, to cut wood and peel
potatoes. A stock of these vege¬
tables a staple item on the school
menu is provided by parents.
Meals also include porridge and
dried milk supplied by the
Peruvian Government. There
are rarely more than 10 to 12
children in school at one time,
since parents often need
their help in the fields.
Martin, the oldest boy in the
school (aged 13), plays
his flute on the high plateau.
Rough stone walls in distance
are corrals in which vicunas,
alpacas and llamas are
shut up for the night to protect
them from pumas and
bears. Different tunes
played on the flute tell the herds
when to enter and leave the corrals.
