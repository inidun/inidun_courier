THE YEARS
OF THE QUIET SUN
Dressed warmly against the cold, a mountain-top
observer of the Soviet Far Eastern Solar
Service studies the rising sun.
Scientists in all parts of the
world are today studying the re¬
sults of a vast international
research programme into solar
activity and its influence on the
earth. Here two Soviet geophysi-
cists describe how in 1964-65 the
world became one vast labora¬
tory in which scientists from over
70 countries joined forces in a
co-ordinated effort to learn more
about solar-terrestrial relations.

O the uninitiated, the
phrase "years of the quiet
sun" may have an odd sound, remind¬
ful of some ancient calendar of the
East, perhaps of a poetic figure of
speech. Yet it happens to be a strictly
scientific term which is applied to
a great scientific project, recently
completed and widely reported.
Men have looked up to the sun as
the source of life since the earliest
times, and the worship of the sun last¬
ed in many lands until men learned
to look for rational explanations of
NICOLAI PUSHKOV, a prominent Soviet
geophysicist (and winner of the Lenin Prize)
is director of the Institute of Terrestrial
Magnetism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave
Propagation of the U.S.S.R. Academy of
Sciences. He is also a vice-president of
the Committee for the International Years
of the Quiet Sun (IQSY).
BORIS SILKIN, an eminent researcher, is
a member of the Soviet Geophysical
Committee (Presidium of the U.S.S.R. Acad¬
emy of Sciences). He took part in the
International Geophysical Year and the
IQSY, and has written books and studies
on these international research projects.
natural phenomena. The sun-god Ra
of the ancient Egyptians; Helios, iden¬
tified with Apollo, worshipped in an¬
cient Greece and Rome; the merry
Yarilo of the ancient Slavs (the god
of the life-giving forces of nature)
these were all held to be incarnations,
or embodiments, of the sun.
Centuries were to pass before men
learned to base their knowledge on
facts rather than faith, and it was only
during the Renaissance in Europe
that they began to test and experi¬
ment in various fields of science. In
1609 Galileo Galilei may be said to
have rediscovered the heavens when
he first trained his telescope on the
moon.
Three and a half centuries have
rolled by since then, and we may ask
ourselves the question: What have
we learned about the sun since those
times? i
We have learned, for one thing,
that the sun does not always remain
changeless but is subject to periods
of greater or lesser activity. Sunspots,
noticed in antiquity and observed by
Galileo, appear upon its face with
definite regularity, their number
increasing over a period of three or
four years, after which they decay,
solar activity sinks to a minimum, and
the sun remains relatively undisturb¬
ed. This quiet period continues two
or three years after which solar ac¬
tivity again begins to increase. The
entire cycle from one maximum to
another is completed in a little over
1 1 years.
Other phenomena besides the sun-
spots are subject to these cycles: the
faculae, or bright regions of the sun's
photosphere; chromospheric flares;
and prominences, or tongues of flame,
leaping hundreds of thousands of kilo¬
metres high over the solar surface.
These various phenomena are im¬
portant and hence of great interest
to the scientists. Moreover, they are
of no mere academic interest, for the
construction of some new hypothesis,
for example. Nor is it only that the sun
is our nearest star and the only one
that admits of direct observation,
being merely 150 million kilometres
away, whereas the nearest other stars

QUIET SUN (Continued)
Concerted effort by thousands of scientists
are hundreds of thousands of times
more distant.
It is the continuous and varied
influence of the sun on the earth that
explains our interest, rather than the
fact that observation of the sun advan¬
ces stellar astronomy.
Everyone is familiar with the inter¬
ferences that frequently occur in radio
transmissions. The local broadcast¬
ing station that regularly comes over
so clearly all at once begins to fade
out and another station, possibly un¬
identified and far away, comes in. This
is all very well if one has been tun¬
ed in to a programme of music, but
quite another thing in the case of a
radio beacon, for in that event ships
and aircraft may face distress as a
result of confusion in the ether. Or,
to take another example, the needle
of the compass on which you are
accustomed to rely may unexpectedly
begin to swing away from a given
point, and here again the results may
be serious.
In both cases solar phenomena are
at the root of the trouble.
Solar activity, therefore, and solar-
terrestrial effects require painstaking
observation. We need to know more
about the various solar phenomena
and to learn how to deal with or,
rather, adapt ourselves to the effect
of the turbulent activity of the sun
that has so direct a bearing on our
existence.
The recent international geophysical
year (IGY) was a good example of
such observation. Within the frame¬
work of its 1957-59 programme a great
deal of valuable information was
obtained concerning the various ter¬
restrial physical processes and the
nature of solar-terrestrial relations.
As a result, we have improved our
conceptions with regard to our plan¬
et's environment.
Valuable as this mass of informa¬
tion may be, its accuracy must be
proved by comparison. The IGY
happened to coincide with a period
of extremely high solar activity. In
order to arrive at definitive conclu¬
sions, however, we must observe the
sun in the less disturbed phase of
its cycle as well.
While science has so far been un¬
able to discover precisely what is
responsible for changes in solar activ¬
ity, scientists have learned to fore¬
cast such changes quite accurately
on the basis of the 11 -year cycles.
Inasmuch as 1957-59 had been a
period of maximum solar activity, they
were able to predict a period of
lessened disturbance in 1964-65.
This prediction . gave rise to the
idea of organizing an International
Years of the Quiet Sun project, or
IQSY. When the idea was broached in
1960 by some Soviet scientists, it gain¬
ed the immediate support of geophysi-
cists from many lands, convened for
the Geophysical Conference at Hel¬
sinki. It had become quite clear that
the physical phenomena caused by so¬
lar activity are on such a scale that
they must be studied on an internation¬
al level, for no amount of restricted,
national observation could cope with
the problem.
These physical phenomena affect
the earth as a whole, and if any reli¬
able conclusions were to be reached,
it was obvious that scientists would
have to work within the framework of
an internationally integrated program¬
me and familiarize themselves with
data collected all over the world.
If a chemist or an historian needs
to know what his colleagues in other
countries are working on, even if simp-

ly to avoid duplication of research and
to profit from discussion so as to get
the right answers, it is doubly impor¬
tant for the geophysicist to do so,
for the object of his study is the
earth as a whole. Uniformity of exper¬
iment, co-ordination of observation
and comparison of data collected are
of fundamental importance to the geo¬
physicist; without them it is impossible
to unravel phenomena of a universal
nature.
In line with the IQSY programme,
our planet became one vast labora¬
tory for the scientists to work in.
Thousands of geophysicists from more
than 70 countries joined forces in a
co-ordinated effort to solve the riddles
of nature. The project received full
support from Unesco and WMO, as
well as various international bodies
of astronomers, physicists, radiophy-
sicists, geodesists and geophysicists;
the committee for space research
(COSPAR) of the International Council
of Scientific Unions and the Special
Committee on Antarctic Research
(SCAR). W.J.G. Beynon of Great
Britain, who was put in charge of the
entire project, was requested by the
International Committee on Geophysics
to work out the general programme
of research.
Academies of sciences and other
similar institutions in dozens of coun¬
tries also responded to an invitation
to participate in the IQSY, thereby
assuring the representation of the five
continents, all the climatic zones, many
different scientific trends, and coun¬
tries with very different levels of devel¬
opment, including those with a history
of many centuries and those who have
just embarked on programmes of econ¬
omic and scientific development.
Japan and Australia are first to greet
the rising sun, and the astronomers
of the Tokyo Observatory train their
telescopes upon it. As the earth
turns upon its axis the sun comes
under the observation of the Soviet
Far Eastern Solar Service situated on
the banks of the Ussuri. An hour or
two later this observation is taken up
by astronomers in Irkutsk, Alma-Ata,
Tashkent and Delhi. As the sun rises
over the Caspian it comes within view
for Azerbaijan scientists at Perkuli,
near Baku, and their Georgian collea¬
gues in the hills of Abastumani. They
are soon joined by Kislovodsk, then
the Crimea, the town of Krasnaya
Pakhra near Moscow, Kiev and Lvov.
The sun is then passed on, as it
were, to the astronomers of Potsdam,
in the German Democratic Republic,
Plzen in Czechoslovakia, Ljubljana In
Yugoslavia, Wroclaw in Poland, Pic
du Midi de Bigorre in France, and
Greenwich in England. On the other
side of the Atlantic telescopes are
ready for it at the Smithsonian Obser¬
vatory at Washington, Arecibo in
Puerto Rico, Boulder in Colorado and
Sacramento Peak in New Mexico,
U.S.A., Tonanzintla in Mexico, and
Ottawa in Canada. South of the
equator, meantime, the watch is carried
on, successively, in South Africa,
Argentina and Peru, until finally the
sun plunges into the Pacific, to rise
again over the eastern fringe of Asia.
We have already remarked that the
IQSY was not an astronomical project,
for we were interested in the effect
of solar-terrestrial inter-relationships
here, at this end; we wanted to know
what kind of impact solar phenomena
have on the earth. Astronomical
observation of the sun, important as
it was, served the participants in the
project merely as a point of depar¬
ture in their work.
The polar regions of our planet are
more than any other of interest
to the geophysicist, for it is here that
the poles of the spherical magnet on
which we live are found. It is here
that the magnetic storms and polar

QUIET SUN (Continued)
aurorae produced by the intrusion of
charged particles out of the cosmos
give displays of particular force. Here,
also, we can observe the very peculiar
behaviour of the upper charged layer
of the earth's atmospheric envelope,
the ionosphere, which reflects incom¬
ing radio waves. And here, finally,
above the endless icy wastes great
currents of air often form that affect
the weather and climate in even very
distant areas.
All these phenomena are directly or
indirectly connected with the whim¬
sical moods of the sun and the nature
of the electromagnetic and corpus¬
cular radiation emanating from it. To
gain a complete concept of the inter¬
relationships of the earth and its
nearest star, therefore, it is necessary
to start with observations carried on
in the polar regions, where the various
features of that concept are particu¬
larly characteristic.
That is precisely the reason why
the attention of the scientists was
focused on the work of the northern¬
most outposts of IQSY at the stations
North Pole 12, North Pole 13 and
North Pole 14, whose teams carried
on through the snowstorms of the
endless polar night, studying magnet¬
ic storms and polar aurorae in the
high latitudes of the Arctic and observ¬
ing the propagation of radio waves
and the behaviour of cosmic rays
when the sun is undisturbed.
The Antarctic ice-cap at the other
pole was made the subject of similar
study. At Vostok Station, near to the
earth's magnetic pole and cold pole,
Soviet scientists enrolled in the pro¬
ject carried on through the winter
despite temperatures of 80 degrees
Centigrade below zero.
The world's coldest continent be¬
came the land with the highest per¬
centage of scientists, a scientists'
continent, where co-operation among
the specialists from the participating
countries reached a record high. At
Vostok station and the Mirny Obser¬
vatory, Soviet scientists worked to¬
gether with their American, French,
German Democratic Republic, Czecho¬
slovak and Hungarian colleagues, while
Soviet geophysicists wintered and
worked at the American McMurdo
station. This fruitful collaboration
made it possible to achieve higher
levels of perfection in the various
schools of science and increase our
common fund of knowledge.
Each participating country carried
out its own national project, set up
within the framework of the overall
programme. Considerably more than
one hundred "Cosmos" type satellites
were launched under the Soviet pro¬
gramme to carry out a wide variety
of observations in circumplanetary
space, precisely where solar phenom¬
ena have their first impact on our
planet.
Four "Electron" type satellites were
launched in the U.S.S.R. specially for
IQSY purposes, whose orbits, draw¬
ing alternately away from and closer
to the earth, covered an extensive
part of its immediate environment and
were thus able to establish with
greater precision the pattern of its
magnetic field, to study the streams
of particles ejected from the sun and
its X-ray radiation, to capture micro-
meteorites, to study the electrons
present in the earth's radiation zones
discovered by American and Soviet
scientists under the IGY programme
and to determine the chemical compo¬
sition of cosmic rays.
American scientists launched sev¬
eral "Explorer" type satellites under
the IQSY programme which they used
to measure the magnetic field of
charged particles; to classify elec¬
trons by the direction of their move¬
ment and the size of their charge;
to study cosmic rays and the recently
discovered "solar wind", or particle
stream, that fans the earth; and to
measure the density of the terrestrial
atmosphere on its outer fringes, i.e.
where it merges into cosmic space.
The American "Oso" and "Ogo" type
satellites collected information on the
genesis of solar flares and the nature
of the particles launched into the
cosmos from the solar surface at their
genesis.
British "Ariel" type satellites were

CATACLYSMIC
ERUPTIONS
Above the surface of the sun is a
layer of lighter and cooler gas call¬
ed the chromosphere, so named
because it gives out scarlet light.
Great streams of glowing hydrogen
called prominences often shoot
through the chromosphere, some¬
times for hundreds of thousands of
miles. Left, the largest of these
cataclysmic solar outbursts ever
observed (on June 4, 1946). It
expanded like a giant fiery bubble,
reaching its maximum height in the
fifth photograph. Forty-nine minutes
later (last photo) it had almost
disappeared. (Numbers indicate time
when each photograph was taken.)
Violent, but short-lived, solar flares
also appear on the sun's surface.
These send out electrically charged
particles which on reaching the earth
affect the compass needle and inter¬
fere with radio transmissions, caus¬
ing fade-outs. When they collide
with atoms and molecules in the
earth's atmosphere, these particles
also produce the auroral displays
(right) chiefly seen in polar regions.
USIS
used to measure micrometeorites
and to carry out experiments to deter¬
mine the behaviour of ozone, the
"brittle"gas whose genesis in the
atmosphere depends on the ultraviolet
rays of the sun. "Alouette", the Ca¬
nadian satellite sent up into the iono¬
sphere, was used to establish the
relationship of the ionosphere with
the genesis of polar aurorae.
Needless to say, the IQSY pro¬
gramme covered much more than the
cosmos: a worldwide network was set
up, comprising 240 scientific stations
and laboratories for measuring the
earth's magnetic field, 180 stations
for observing polar aurorae, 270
stations for probing the ionosphere,
close to 1,000 meteorological stations
for studying the atmosphere, climates
and weather, 105 stations for captur¬
ing cosmic rays, 110 observatories for
recording the solar manifestations
responsible for all this diversity of
phenomena.
In addition to the cosmic experiments
already mentioned, land-based Soviet
geophysicists, for instance, effected
their observations with the aid of a
vast network of stations stretching
from the country's western boundaries
to the Soviet Far East and from the
Kola Peninsula beyond the Arctic
Circle and Yakutia to Transcaucasia
and Central Asia.
Thousands of Soviet geophysicists
attached to the Academy of Sciences
of the U.S.S.R. and the academies of
many of the Union republics joined
this fact-finding scientific campaign.
The country's foremost universities
co-operated in the effort to penetrate
the mysteries of solar-terrestrial
effects teachers, researchers and
enthusiastic students, the future geo¬
physicists, all joined in this work. No
small contribution to the IQSY was
made by the scientific bodies of the
Soviet Meteorological Service.
The Institute of Terrestrial Magne¬
tism, Ionosphere, and Radio Wave
Propagation (of the U.S.S.R. Academy
of Sciences) brought into prominence
as an IQSY centre the small town
of Krasnaya Pakhra near which it is
situated in the Moscow countryside.
One of the Institute's departments
was continually on the move the
schooner "Zarya", the world's only
non-magnetic vessel. The "Zarya"
carried the IQSY flag over tens of
thousands of miles, as it sailed the
Baltic, North, Greenland and Norwe¬
gian Seas and the wide reaches of
the Atlantic Ocean down to the equa¬
tor, sounding and measuring to pro¬
cure the data to be used for making
precision marine charts of magnetic
declinations.
A very extensive network of scien¬
tific stations and observatories was
deployed by the geophysicists of the
U.S.A. to carry out the diverse obser
vations provided for by the IQSY
programme. This network covered
the country from Point Barrow in
Alaska down to Cape Kennedy in
Florida.
Work upon the project was also
carried on by American scientists in
Antarctica: at the McMurdo Observa¬
tory, at eight stations built specially
for electromagnetic observation, and
at the Amundsen-Scott Station, situat¬
ed at the geographic South Pole, or
as far down as one can go on our
planet.
Interesting experiments in the field
of polar aurorae and cosmic rays were
carried out in the southern ocean by
the American expeditionary vessel
"Eltanin". In many lands as widely
scattered as Iceland, South Africa,
Morocco and Japan, American scien¬
tists carried on observations in co¬
operation with local geophysicists.
British scientists carried out their
study of atmospheric physics and
various weather phenomena in their
relationship to the Quiet Sun at
stations on the British Isles, on board
four special weather ships cruising
the North Atlantic and on board the
famous research vessel "Discovery"
assigned to the Indian Ocean. The
earth's magnetic field was studied by
home stations, by stations on Mau
tius Island and on board the scientific
ship "Vidal"

Solar observations from land, sea and space
28
The British network of stations
designated to observe the polar auro¬
rae stretched from North Scotland to
Halley Bay In Antarctica, while the
stations studying the ionosphere
were scattered from Edinburgh and
Sheffield to Singapore and the Wed-
dell Sea that washes the Antarctic
ice-cap. The English climate did not
appear to interfere with radio observa¬
tion of the sun, which was success-
fulry carried on with the aid of the
giant 75-metre radio telescope of the
Jodrell Bank Observatory. A regular
battery of scientific instruments was
set up on the Woomera Range in
Australia for launching the British
"Skylark" rockets Into the upper layers
of the atmosphere.
A substantial contribution to the
project was made by the scientists
of the Federal German Republic. The
Max Planck Institute of Aeronomy
built an observatory in the Harz
Mountains, which was used for the
observation of satellites and the study
of the behaviour of the ionosphere.
The Scherhag Institute in Berlin under¬
took to prepare daily weather charts
for the entire northern hemisphere,
and this made it possible to study
the effect of solar perturbations on
stratosphere temperatures.
An interesting and important pro¬
gramme was implemented by the
scientists of the German Democratic
Republic. Ozone, in its relationship
with the fitful behaviour of the sun,
was studied at Potsdam, magnetic
variations coinciding with the days of
an undisturbed sun were recorded at
Niemegk; and studies in the field of
wave propagation were carried on at
Kuhlungsborn.
A major part of the IQSY pro¬
gramme was Implemented by the geo¬
physicists of Czechoslovakia, Japan,
France, India, Canada, Poland, Italy
and Australia. While space does not
permit mentioning their individual
contributions, it may be said' that the
work of each was integrated in this
international effort, and each carried
an important share.
The Information on solar-terrestrial
effects collected over the period
covered by the IQSY in such widely
scattered areas as Yakutia in Soviet
Siberia, the Peruvian Andes, Antarctica
and the Island of Capri, will serve, in
all the 70 participating countries, as
a point of departure for scientific
theorizing in search of explanations
for worldwide physical processes.
While the most important conclu¬
sions still remain to be drawn, some
have already become apparent. Thus,
while the sun was undisturbed polar
aurorae were rarely observed outside
the Arctic and the Antarctic. There
were fewer magnetic and ionospheric
storms to cause compass deviations
and black out radio communication.
A deterioration was observed of the
flux of X-rays and ultraviolet rays and
the shower of incoming charged par¬
ticles. Changing conditions in the upper
atmosphere brought about a measure
of change in weather phenomena.
Changes were also observed In the
pattern of radiation zones encircling
our planet.
Rockets yielded a great amount of
information on the upper layers of the
atmosphere, which is precisely where
the earth's atmospheric envelope
receives most of the impact of the
various solar emanations. More in¬
formation is now available on the flux,
reflection and distribution of solar
heat; on the movement of large air
masses; on the behaviour of cloud
canopies; and on the effect of solar
activity on the density of the upper
atmosphere.
The expedition on the "Zarya"
discovered extensive magnetic anom¬
alies in the North Atlantic, off the
coasts of the British Isles.
The study of polar aurorae has
dispelled some of the mystery
surrounding the chemical composition
of the upper atmosphere, which was
discovered to contain atomic hydrogen
and helium of terrestrial origin. It Is
now clear that the chemical composi¬
tion of the outer ionosphere Is much
more complex than hitherto thought,
and that even short radio waves can
migrate repeatedly from hemisphere
to hemisphere following the terres¬
trial magnetic lines of force. Scientists
were able to establish that the intensity
of the cosmic rays, and more partic¬
ularly that of their component low
charge particles, roughly doubles dur¬
ing the period of an undisturbed sun,
while the flux of positive ions dwindles
to half Its volume.
It ¡s impossible to enumerate all the
scientific achievements under the
IQSY programme, all the more so as
progress in the field of geophysics
is nowadays almost too rapid to
follow.
The IQSY project is an excellent
example of the kind of joint effort on
an international scale that is required
by the very nature of the field under
study. Perhaps its greatest signifi¬
cance lies in the fact that it has
brilliantly demonstrated the fruitfulness
of businesslike co-operation among
the scientists of all lands.
