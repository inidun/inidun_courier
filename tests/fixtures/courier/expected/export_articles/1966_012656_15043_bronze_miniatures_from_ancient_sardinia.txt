access and exposed at all times to
invasion (it has experienced no less
than ten periods of outside domi¬
nation). Yet paradoxically it has lived
through a score of centuries almost
always unaffected by the great changes
of history, as though it were a remote
corner of our planet.
Nevertheless, during the second mil¬
lennium B.C. well before the series
of foreign occupations began with the
arrival of the Phoenicians an ancient
and mysterious people, whose place
of origin no one has been able to
establish, created a distinctive form of
civilization which lasted for at least a
thousand years (from 1500 to about
500 B.C.). The sources of this civiliza¬
tion are bound up with the legend of
King Sardus, the eponymous hero who,
according to the Greek historian Pau-
sanias, ruled over the first inhabitants
of the island.
Curious traces of this civilization,
developed In part through the influence
of the richer and more mature cultures
of the Eastern Mediterranean and Asia
Minor, are preserved for us in the im¬
posing truncated-cone constructions
known as nuraghi, which have given
their name to the whole of this histor¬
ical period and are to be found by
the thousand along the coast and in
the interior of the island; and in a few
hundred bronze statuettes, the now
famous bronzetti.

ACOLYTE BEARING OFFERING.
The ancients of Sardinia
offered up animals,
food and drink to their gods.
The story told by the nuraghi and
the bronzetti is perhaps the most fas¬
cinating chapter in the history of Sar¬
dinia.
A nuraghe was a fortified house, the
dwelling of the chief of the tribe or
clan; it was a real fortress, rearing its
massive bulk in the midst of a com¬
plex of smaller stone buildings, all,
like the nuraghe itself, circular in
shape. The whole formed an actual
hamlet, an urban settlement (a "nuraghi
village" in fact), which, one can rea¬
sonably assume, marks the transition
of the ancient Sardinian society from
a nomadic existence of plunder and
violence, and a pastoral economy, to
a new and more advanced form of
community life, based on a mixed econ¬
omy. The nuraghi period indicates
the first Instance of an autonomous
Sardinian culture with a distinctive
structure and purposes of its own.
While, in view of the complete
absence of graphic evidence and of
decorative elements on the outer and
Inner surfaces of their cyclopean walls,
the nuraghi tell us very little about the
ancient island people, studies of the
bronzetti have on the contrary enabled
archaeologists and historians to shed
some revealing light on this interesting
period of Sardinia's history.
There are about 400 of these small
bronze sculptures, most of which are
kept at the National Museum in Caglia-
ri, the capital of the island. They vary
in height from 8 to 30 cm. (3 to 12 in.);
some are broken, but despite the long
erosion of time, they are in an excel¬
lent state of preservation.
These statuettes were found chiefly
In the sanctuaries the most famous
of all being that of Santa Vittoria di
Serri which the ancient Sardinians
built on lonely heights near to springs;
only rarely were they discovered in
tombs, and practically never in the
nuraghi. The fact that they come
mostly from the sanctuaries in itself
shows that they were ex-votos, offer¬
ings from the faithful to the deity in
propitiation when asking aid, or in grat¬
itude for help received; confirmation
of their votive purpose is occasionally
provided by insertion fitments in their
bases.
Tribal chiefs, priests and priestesses,
warriors, wrestlers, musicians, acolytes
bearing offerings of cakes or animals
to the deity, small funeral ships,
dagger and sword hilts have been
found. The theocratic and military char¬
acter of this society, with religion and
politics merging, is quite apparent.
It is a society in which the tribal
chief, equipped with the ritual sacri¬
ficial knife and with the staff of office,
unites in himself both civil and reli¬
gious authority, and where the warrior,
often distinguished by superhuman
traits (four eyes, symbolizing shrewd¬
ness and foresight), holds out his
shield as a sign of its dedication to
the invisible god.
The study of these ex-vofos has
given us some idea, although by no
means a full one, of the beliefs and
religious practices of the proto-Sardin-
ians. Without graphic evidence, relig¬
ious literature or historical Informa¬
tion, we must resort to the comparative
method, looking to the religions of Asia
Minor and the Central and Eastern
Mediterranean to throw light on the
religious significance of most of the
bronzes. Along with the statuettes
depicting priests and priestesses, with
their right hands raised in adoration,
acolytes and offering-bearers, we find
representations, often in limestone or
basalt, of the Great Goddess, some¬
times supporting on her lap a young
dead god.
Associated with this basic cult of
the Great Goddess, the Earth Mother,
the mighty Life-Giver, the principle of
abundance and fertility, represented
primarily by vegetation and spring
water (who was probably worshipped
all over the island), were elements
common to all the Mediterranean reli-
THE GODDESS MOTHER.

gions, such as the survival of the indi¬
vidual soul and the belief that death
does not permanently sever the rela¬
tions of the dead with the living.
Domestic objects found beside skele¬
tons, lamps to lighten the darkness of
the grave, bowls for use in the pre¬
paration of the dead man's food, and
little ships symbolizing his long journey
through the kingdom beyond the tomb
all these are proof of such a belief.
Certain practices also testify to the
fact that these peoples believed in the
continuance of relations between the
living and the dead; an example of
this is "incubation": a prolonged sleep,
even lasting several days, near the
tombs hollowed out from the rock (the
domus de ¡anas, or "spirit houses", as
the country people still call them), the
aim being to obtain either the cure of
illness, or revelatory dreams.
Clothing, religious feasts, propitia¬
tory rites, and offensive and defensive
weapons all help us to build up a
picture of the theocratic and military
structure of the nuraghi society, as it
may be deduced from a careful ana¬
lysis of these little sculptures.
Historians and art critics began to
be interested in the bronzetti at the end
of the eighteenth century, when the
German archaeologist, J.J. Winckel-
mann, a theorist of neo-classical taste,
summarily dismissed them, for appear¬
ance and workmanship, as "quite bar¬
baric" (ganz barbarisch). No less nega¬
tive was the opinion expressed by La
Marmora, the first great hnodern his¬
torian of Sardinia, in the first half of
the nineteenth century. Today, criti¬
cism has revised its view of these
ancient examples of the Sardinians'
skill in the plastic arts, considering
them quite rightly as some of the live¬
liest expressions of late neolithic art
among the peoples of the Mediterran¬
ean. The absence of monstrosities
emphasizes the poise and restraint
of their figurative imagination.
Unlike the rudimentary pottery of
the nuraghi civilization, which repeats
the motifs of geometrical design
(ribbons, dog-tooth patterns and con¬
centric circles), characteristic of the
late neolithic pottery of the Eastern
and Western Mediterranean, the bron-
zetti bear witness to an original stream
of artistic development, clearly distin¬
guished from similar art forms in the
Mediterranean regions.
As for their dating, a few decades
ago it was thought, that the bronzetti
went back to the second millennium.
Archaeologists now date them from the
first millennium, linking them with the
archaic geometric sculpture typical of
the Graeco-Latin figurative' arts of the
same period. According to the Italian
archaeologist Massimo Pallottino, the
bronzetti belong to the pre-archaic
minor sculpture of the proto-historical
Mediterranean. "Thus", he writes,
"certain similarities of structure, tech¬
nique and ~even of significant details
can be perceived between the Sardin¬
ian bronze figurines and those of
Luristan, Armenia, Syria, Asia Minor,
Greece, Italy and Iberia."
It is not possible, however, to say
for certain which of these art regions
exerted the greatest influence on the
development of paleo-Sardinian plas¬
tic forms. The geometrical style could
have been imported from Syria by the
Phoenicians. On the other hand, the
discovery, in the so-called "tomb of
the leader" at Vetulonia, of a beautiful
little bronze ship, clearly of Sardinian
inspiration, may support the hypothe¬
sis that there were contacts in art with
Etruria.
Nevertheless, it cannot be denied
that the nuraghi culture possessed
strong artistic feeling. The merits and
significance of the creations of prim¬
itive man cannot be judged by the
standards of the academic formalism
prevalent among archaeologists in the
past. Though concerned with convey¬
ing religious reality in symbolic form,
the ancient Sardinian artist was un¬
doubtedly able, with marvellous in¬
stinctive feeling, to create authentic
works of art.
