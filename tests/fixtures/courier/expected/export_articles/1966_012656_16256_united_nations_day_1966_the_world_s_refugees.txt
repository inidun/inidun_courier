THE
WORLD'S
REFUGEES

United Nations Day (October
24) this year will be dedicat¬
ed to the cause of the world's
refugees. In 1965 the United
Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees was concerned
with over 3,000,000 refugees
in various parts of the world.
Most of them were satisfac¬
torily resettled, or were
being re-established in the
countries granting them asy¬
lum, but substantial numbers
still need help.
I N Europe alone 650,000
refugees come within the
mandate of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Some 12,000 of them are still in need
of help, and projects for their final
resettlement are now being carried out.
But in recent years new refugees have
been crossing frontiers at the rate of
10,000 a year.
A quick look at statistics from around
the world reveals the universal char¬
acter of refugee problems:
The United States has received
470,000 refugees; Canada 35,000;
Australia 50,000; and Latin America
125.000;
Africa has about 570,000 refugees,
over 200,000 of whom were aided by
UNHCR in 1965;

Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,

In India, 45,000 refugees are being
helped by the government and by
voluntary organizations in other coun¬
tries;
In Nepal, UNHCR, in co-operation
with a number of voluntary organiza¬
tions and with the Swiss government,
is trying to find homes for about 7,000
refugees;
The authorities in Macao, together
with UNHCR and various organizations,
are helping about 80,000 refugees,
many of them sick or incapacitated.
Statistics, of course, merely make
us aware of the magnitude of the prob¬
lem. The fate of the refugee is but
one of the countless ills that weigh
on mankind, yet what could be
harder to endure than the lot of the
refugee, for whom fear and uncertainty
are added to material privation. What
he needs above all is to feel secure.
Experience shows that once he regains
his sense of security, even a small
amount of help will stimulate his own

REFUGEES (Continued)

initiative to make contact with others,
and will give him the will to carry on.
Ten years ago, the number of refu¬
gees in the world ran into millions
in India, Pakistan, Viet-Nam, Korea and
finally, Europe, where displaced per¬
sons were waiting for a rare chance
to emigrate (see the Unesco Courier,
January 1956).
Yet optimism of a kind was begin¬
ning to break through. With the help
of fellow citizens, the "national refu¬
gees", who had settled in countries
of which they were originally citizens,
were gradually overcoming their initial
trials. The others the million stateless
persons scattered throughout Europe
were beginning to benefit from the
assistance provided by UNHCR.
When the High Commissioner's post
was created in 1951, his field of
action was confined to international
protection, but by 1956 the scope of
the work had been expanded by funds
enabling him to implement programmes
designed to help integrate people for
whom, it had been thought, there was
little hope of resettlement.
These programmes were planned to
cover a period of ten years; in Europe,
they are now nearing completion.
They have also made possible the
resettlement of over 100,000 refugees
In Europe and the Middle East.
The programmes comprised a wide
variety of measures: low-rental ac¬
commodation in buildings constructed
with non-interest loans from UNHCR;
money and gifts to help provide fur¬
niture and occupational equipment;
accommodation in old peoples' homes
or hospitals for the aged and sick;
study and apprenticeship grants for
young people; occupational training for
the disabled; rehabilitation, vocational
guidance and legal aid.
While encouraging the on-the-spot
assimilation of refugees by such
measures, UNHCR continued to facili¬
tate migration within Europe and over¬
seas, with the collaboration of the
Intergovernmental Committee for Euro¬
pean Migration (ICEM), an organization
which provides emigrants with informa¬
tion and transportation.
It therefore seemed likely that post¬
war problems would vanish sooner
or later. Unfortunately, circumstances
proved such optimism to be unfounded.
In some areas, the old wounds were
still not healed; Arab refugees from
Palestine, for example, were still lead¬
ing a precarious existence in their
camps. The United Nations Relief and
Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestine
refugees is still helping them; but for
it, they would not have the barest
essentials. The joint UNRWA-Unesco
educational programme has provided
schooling for 200,000 refugee children
in these camps. Between 1958 and
1962, UNHCR and the League of Red
Cross Societies helped over 200,000
Algerians in Tunisia and Morocco.
At this stage, UNHCR decided to
define the part it should play in
unprecedented and unforeseen situa¬
tions situations in which the United
Nations General Assembly was re¬
questing it to intervene and "lend its
good offices" to assist refugees who
did not necessarily come under its
jurisdiction. Such situations had al¬
ready arisen, in Hong Kong, for exam¬
ple.
Through its "good offices" UNHCR
was also able to give prompt relief to
the African refugees, whose problems
were aggravated when countries pre¬
viously under colonial administration
achieved independence. Social, relig¬
ious and political disturbances led to
large-scale population movements,
involving whole communities, in over
ten countries in tropical Africa.
There were 270,000 refugees in the
Congo, 50,000 in Senegal, about
150,000 in Uganda, 5,000 in Zambia,
21,000 in the Central African Republic,
5,000 in Togo, 65,000 in Burundi, 27,000
in Tanzania and several thousand in
Rwanda nearly 600,000 uprooted peo¬
ple whose presence in the countries
that had received them was creating
difficult and urgent problems.
The most remarkable episode in the
African refugees' search for a new
homeland is undoubtedly that of the
Batutsi from Rwanda, who fled to the
Kivu in 1962, when Rwanda achieved
its independence (see the Unesco
Courier, January 1963). The Batutsi
numbered about 600,000. By 1964,
plans for their resettlement were
already advanced, thanks to the com¬
bined efforts of the League of Red
Cross Societies, UNHCR and the
International Labour Organization.
Disturbances broke out in the region,
however, interrupting work and making
life there precarious, if not impossible,
for many refugees.
Many of them set off again, this
time to Burundi, an already over-
populated country. At this juncture,
Tanzania generously offered to take
some of them, and UNHCR decided to
transport a group of 3,000 volunteers
there.
It was a long, tortuous journey; the
refugees had to cross Lake Kivu by
boat, fly over Rwanda, and travel by
train and truck to their destination

In the first years
of this decade
there were about
150,000 refugees
in this country.
over the high plateaux of Mwezi (in
Swahili, the plateaux of the moon)
and all this to go 1,000 kilometres (625
miles. Todaya year laterthe 3,000
emigrants from Rwanda have cleared,
irrigated and ploughed the land and
built roads, dwellings, dispensaries
and schools. In short, they have
brought civilization to this part of
Africa.
For the High Commissioner for Ref¬
ugees it is an absolute rule never,
in any circumstances, to intervene in
any situation involving refugees unless
he is requested so to do by the govern¬
ment of a host country. UNHCR first
deals with the most urgent needs, and,
on the advice of an expert on the spot,
opens limited provisional credits to
cover emergency aid.
UNHCR itself, however, has no
operational powers; it therefore has
to call upon an organization such as
the League of Red Cross Societies,
which sends its delegates and medical
teams to the spot and, In many cases,
employs its own methods to obtain
assistance in cash and in kind for the
work it is undertaking.
There are many other organizations,
however, besides this traditional collab¬
orator, which participate, at the re¬
quest of UNHCR, in its various assis¬
tance programmes, and especially in
resettlement projects. In implement-

-------------------- Page 31 --------------------

ing these, UNHCR calls upon the
United Nations specialized agencies
such as ILO, WHO, FAO, or the United
Nations Development Programme.
Unesco uses its experience to provide
aid progressively Increasing for the
education of the refugees and their
children. The World Food Programme
is also asked to assist, especially in
the initial stages of resettlement in
rural areas, in providing food for the
refugees until their own harvests can
meet their needs.
These organizations, moreover, are
concerned with promoting the system¬
atic economic and social development
of whole regions, and the operations
they undertake to assist new arrivals
have to be co-ordinated with the rate
of progress in the country in which
they are settling.
In terms of actual assistance, there¬
fore, UNHCR acts as a co-ordinator
and a go-between. Its small budget
($ 3,500,000 In 1965) from the voluntary
contributions of 57 governments can
barely cover more than a fraction of
an assistance programme, but that
fraction is often of the greatest import¬
ance, since it provides the impetus
for an upsurge of international solidar¬
ity and co-operation.
But the strength of UNHCR is that,
In a given situation, its role is that
of a disinterested party acting on
behalf of the community of nations,
whose sole interest is the humanitar¬
ian aspect of the problems to be
solved.
This stand debars It from concerning
itself with the political reasons for the
refugees' plight but also earns it the
confidence of governments.
More and more countries 49 to
date have signed the 1951 Convention
on the Status of Refugees. Many
others, following the principles laid
down by the Convention, have given
all their refugees a status guaranteeing
that they will not be sent back to a
country where their life or liberty would
be endangered because of their race,
religion or nationality, or because of the
social group they belong to or the
political opinions they hold.
Although it is for the authorities in
the host country to determine the stat¬
us of the refugee, UNHCR has super¬
visory rights in this matter, and in most
of the countries where it maintains a
representative and which have signed
the Convention it is able to uphold the
cause of the refugee. A special travel
document, issued in accordance with
the Convention, enables refugees to
travel, which they could not otherwise
do, for lack of a national passport.
UNHCR has also encouraged the
conclusion of other international agree
ments designed to improve the lot of
the refugee. The Agreement relating
to Refugee Seamen, for instance, which
entered into force in 1961, helps sea¬
men who have no travel documents to
obtain legal status. Through close co¬
operation with other intergovernmental
organizations, UNHCR is continuing its
efforts to extend the right of seeking
asylum to all refugees, to simplify the
process of obtaining identity papers, to
secure for refugees the right to pursue
the liberal professions, to make it
easier for refugees to go from one
country to another, and so on.
Aiding refugees is essentially a hu¬
mane task, and one which serves the
cause of peace; but it should also
be as it aims to be constructive.
Its object, in the densely populated
countries of Europe or in the sparsely
populated regions of Africa, Is to settle
refugees Into the community and to
help them to become self-supporting
and integrated as speedily as possible.
United Nations Day, October 24, 1966,
will mark the launching of a fund-raising
campaign in many European countries to
aid refugees, mainly in Africa and Asia.
Proceeds will help to finance re-settlement
projects and also rural settlement centres,
dispensaries and schools projects with
which a great many private voluntary organ¬
izations as well as the U.N. specialized
agencies are associated.
